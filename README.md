WHAT IT DOES?

	This is a simple script to be used in the Gearbox' 2012 title Borderlands 2. It has these purposes:
	1. Quick fire for quality of life mainly with Jakobs' Weapons:
		As much as I appreciate this game, most of the weapon gimmicks are (in my humble opinion)
		badly thought of. Jakobs has the gimmick of Firing as fast as you can pull the trigger,
		while that is a valid gimmick, I feel most jakobs weapons go straight to the selling bin
		because of both the physical strain it requires to use it (Clicking like a crazy man) and
		the general lack of DPS compared to competing brands weapons'.
		
	2. Quick Reload for weapons that have such a slow reload they end up being useless:
		Some Weapon brands (Looking at you, Torgue) have a snail paced reload speed. This, paired
		with the VERY slow rate of fire AND the minuscule magazine capacity make them go straight
		to the selling bin of many players, which is a shame, since their weapons are usually good
		otherwise. Whenever you drop a weapon in Borderlands, and you pick it up again, it comes
		with a full clip. This led to the old, albeit still working, exploit of dropping your weapon
		and picking it up again. This script is merely to facilitate such endevor AND avoid the
		very rare but still there bug of weapons falling through the floor.	
		
	3. This script is made with the Borderlands 2 Community Patch in mind, which I strongly recommend
	anyone still playing this game to use it.[1] 
		As such I made a script to autoexecute the console command you're required to input on each 
		and every game start. That autoexec should make life easier for anyone using the community 
		patch.
		
		
	
HOW DO I USE IT?

	First off: This is an AutoHotkey script, as such you will need to download and install Autohotkey 
	to use it properly.
