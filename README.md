WHAT IT DOES?

	This is a simple script to be used in the Gearbox' 2012 title Borderlands 2. It has these purposes:
	
	1. Quick fire for quality of life:
		As much as I appreciate this game, most of the brands gimmicks are (in my humble opinion)
		badly thought of. Specially Jakobs', which has the infamous gimmick of "firing as fast as 
		you can pull the trigger". While that is a valid gimmick, I feel most jakobs weapons go 
		straight to the selling bin because of both the physical strain it requires to use it 
		(Clicking like an absolute lunatic) and the general lack of damage it deals compared to 
		competing brands weapons'. This is why this script is here. It makes Jakobs' weapons 
		usable or atleast fun to use. And hey, it can also be used to buy ammo really quick.
		
	2. Quick Reload for weapons that have such a slow reload they end up being useless:
		Particular weapons or weapon brands (Looking at you, Torgue) have a snail paced reload 
		speed. This, paired with the VERY slow rate of fire (and sometimes the minuscule magazine 
		capacity) make them go straight to the selling bin of many players, which is a shame, 
		since these weapons would be usually good otherwise. Whenever you drop a weapon in 
		Borderlands, and you pick it up again, it comes back with a full clip. This led to the old, 
		albeit still working, exploit of dropping your weapon and picking it up again. This script 
		is merely to facilitate such endevor AND avoid weapons being temporarily (or not) lost 
		in the heat of battle.	
		
	3. This script is made with the Borderlands 2 Community Patch in mind, which I strongly recommend
	anyone still playing this game to use it.[1] 
		As such there's a script paired with this to autoexecute the console command you're 
		required to input on each and every game start. That autoexec should make life easier for 
		anyone using the community patch.
		
		
	
HOW DO I USE IT?
	
	First off: This is an AutoHotkey script, as such you will need to download and install Autohotkey 
	to use it.
		You can easily download it from:
			https://autohotkey.com/download/
			
	After you download and install autohotkey on your computer, you'll have to set up your hotkeys in
	the BL2SR.ini file. Don't worry, it should be a fairly simple and straightforward process. After
	the proper set up of your keys all you need to do is execute "Borderlands 2 scripts redux.ahk"
	file and you're good to go!
